# Proposals

The initial design process was done through proposals:

1. [Business concepts](./01_business_concepts_proposal.md)
2. [Minimum Viable Product](./02_mvp_proposal.md)
3. [Tech Stack](./03_tech_stack_proposal.md)
4. [Modules structure](./04_modules_proposal.md)
5. [Data structures](./05_data_structures_proposal.md)

These are not documentation of the final product, but rather a snapshot of the design process at the beginning of the project. They are kept here for reference and historical purposes.
